# Mine Sweeper

This is an attempt to implement a Mine Sweeper game, just for fun.

## Compilation

Inside the ```src``` directory, run ```make```.

## Execution

Also inside ```src``` run ```./main```.

## How to play

The game is presented on screen, as a matrix of "H". Each cell represents a possible bomb.
Your goal is to find the bombs. To do so, type a line/column and press enter to reveal a cell.
The revealed number indicates how many bombs are adjacent to the cell.
After revealing all non-bomb cells, type ```0 0``` to end your game. If you found all bombs (or to say, found all non-bombs), the game will show you "VICTORY!".

Pff, whatever, just copy what you want, share with everyone.
